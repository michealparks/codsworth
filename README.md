## Codsworth

Codsworth is an extremely lightweight ambient wallpaper app. 

It works well on an unused screen or as a browser homepage. 

It displays the date, time, weather, and wikipedia's picture of the day with a little blurb about it.

It'll periodically update itself.

It works offline.

That's all!
