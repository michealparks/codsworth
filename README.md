Codsworth is an extremely lightweight ambient wallpaper app. 

It's perfect for an unused screen or a browser home or new tab page. 

It shows you the date, the time, the weather, and the picture of the day from wikipedia with a little blurb about it.

It'll periodically update itself.

That's all.
